Hello, my name is Jake. I am a student at UWRF and will be graduating in December 2022 with a major in Computer Science and Information Systems.

I enjoy all things that are tech related, but take a special interest in botting processes for certain retail sites, such as registration automation.

Stay tuned for more updates on current projects!
